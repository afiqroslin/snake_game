# Snake game with Python and Turtle Graphic

This project is a classic snake game I have developed to practice and improve my python programming skills especially in the use of Turtle Graphic, Git, and OOP to write cleaner code.

To play this game, simply download the zip file or clone this repo to your local PC by running following line in command prompt:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/afiqroslin/snake_game.git
```

Go into executable -> dist, double click on the application and the game is ready to play! No external software/ prerequisite is required.

**NOTE: The executable file can only run on Windows. For Linux, can run the apps by running the script on terminal.**


## Run using command prompt or terminal
For **Windows** open Command Prompt and for **Linux** open Terminal, and run these code:
```bash
    cd \{file_location}\
    python main.py
```
    
## Create Executable file by using PyInstaller

You can easily create one by following these steps:

Install **PyInstaller** on command prompt:

```bash
    pip install PyInstaller
```

Go to your preferred directory and run:
```bash
    cd {Preferred_Directory}\
    pyinstaller --onefile .\main.py
```
You can find the executable program in **dist**, then simply change the program name and you can double click the program to play the game!
