## Create Executable file by using PyInstaller

I also have created executable python program to make it works more like a game.
You can easily create one by following these steps:

Install **PyInstaller** on command prompt:

```bash
    pip install PyInstaller
```

Go to your preferred directory and run:
```bash
    cd {Preferred_Directory}\
    pyinstaller --onefile .\main.py
```
You can find the executable program in **dist**, then simply change the program name and you can double click the program to play the game!

## Run using command prompt or terminal
For **Windows** open Command Prompt and for **Linux** open terminal, and run these code:
```bash
    cd \{file_location}\
    python main.py
```
